# 0x1E. C - Search Algorithms

This repository contains C programs that implement various search algorithms. These search algorithms are fundamental concepts in computer science and are used to efficiently locate elements within a collection of data.

## Description

This project includes implementations of the following search algorithms:
- Linear search
- Binary search

## Requirements

To run the programs in this project, you need to have a C compiler installed on your machine.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/0x1E-C-Search-Algorithms.git
```

2. Compile the desired program using a C compiler. For example, to compile the binary search program:
```
gcc -o binary_search 1-binary.c 1-main.c
```

3. Run the compiled program:
```
./binary_search
```
