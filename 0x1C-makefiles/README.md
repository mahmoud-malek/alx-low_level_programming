# Makefile Projects

This repository contains a series of Makefile projects aimed at understanding and implementing Makefiles for C programs.

## Project Descriptions

### 0-Makefile

Create your first Makefile:
- Builds an executable named 'school' using the rules specified.

### 1-Makefile

Enhancement of the Makefile:
- Uses variables like CC and SRC for easier customization.

### 2-Makefile

Useful Makefile:
- Implements rules to recompile only the updated source files.
- Avoids listing all .o files explicitly.

### 3-Makefile

Complete Makefile with various rules:
- Includes rules for cleaning Emacs and Vim temporary files, object files, and executables.
- Forces recompilation of source files when needed.

### 4-Makefile

Comprehensive Makefile:
- Incorporates additional flags and variables for the compiler.
- Follows strict cleaning rules and recompilation only when necessary.

## Files

- `0-Makefile`: Makefile for the first task.
- `1-Makefile`: Makefile for the second task.
- `2-Makefile`: Makefile for the third task.
- `3-Makefile`: Makefile for the fourth task.
- `4-Makefile`: Makefile for the final task.
- `main.c`, `school.c`: C source files used in the Makefile projects.

## Usage

Each Makefile can be used by invoking `make -f <filename>` in the terminal.

### Example:

To run the first Makefile:

```bash
make -f 0-Makefile
```

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the desired project directory.
3. Execute the desired Makefile using `make -f <filename>`.
